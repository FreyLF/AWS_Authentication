# AWS_Authentication
Micro-service to perform authentication through AWS

1. This project was done in a company I worked previously, so I stripped it from anything that is related to the company.
2. The company decided to not use AWS in the end, so this project was thrown away.
3. The project will not work with only what I here, it needs to be linked to an AWS account and Amplify environment (I also deleted the aws-exports.js file).
