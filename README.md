# AWS_Authentication
Micro-service to perform authentication through AWS

1. This project was done in a company I worked previously, so I stripped it from anything that is related to the company.
2. The company decided to not use AWS in the end, so this project was thrown away.
3. The project will not work with only what is here, it needs to be linked to an AWS account and Amplify environment (I also deleted the aws-exports.js file).
4. This project had some pending features when it was discontinuated, but I did not delete the file that I was using for tests, I thought I might as well leave it in case I come back for whatever reason.
